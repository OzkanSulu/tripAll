# tripAll
A beautiful and functional trip planning website built with modern front-end technologies. The website features an intuitive and user-friendly design that is based on color theory and design principles, making it easy for users to plan and organize their trips.

The website includes essential functions such as a calendar, to help users plan and keep track of their trip dates, and it makes use of the Context API for state management. For those interested in further developing the project, the recommendation is to use Redux Toolkit for improved state management and easier code maintenance.

This website uses images from the assets folder, however, for larger projects, it is suggested to fetch images from a reliable source.

Whether you're planning a personal getaway or a group trip, this website is the perfect tool to help you make the most out of your travels.
